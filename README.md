# OpenCV_Colour-Detection-
The software that was written detects colour and draws a rectangle around the object. It detects the primary colours which are Red, Green, Blue. The project was split into 4 different python files. The main file just reads the video camera and calls the functions to detect colour. The other three files were functions that detect colour.
